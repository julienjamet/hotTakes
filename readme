This branch is used for deployment.

I first deployed my API, then modified my JavaScript code to make the frontend connect to this live version, instead of the local one.

The deployed version of the site can be visited by clicking on the link located in the About section (connecting to the API may take a few seconds).

Note that my hosting platform regularly deletes uploaded images.

That is why all the sauces already created by others will show you the same funny picture I hid under each uploaded image.

If you create your own sauce, you will see your uploaded image and everything will seem to work perfectly for you.

But if come back after a while, your image will also have been deleted and replaced by the same default image as the others.

You will be able to reupload it as many times as you want, but in the end, my host will always win this game.

You can access the code of the local version by switching to the other branch.
