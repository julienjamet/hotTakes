This project has been made during my dev training (MongoDB / Express / Node).

I created the whole [./backend] folder.

My purpose was to build a secure API connected to a database to make the app functional.

The deployed version of the site can be visited by clicking on the link located in the About section (connecting to the API may take a few seconds).

Note that my hosting platform regularly deletes uploaded images.

That is why all the sauces already created by others will show you the same funny picture I hid under each uploaded image.

If you create your own sauce, you will see your uploaded image and everything will seem to work perfectly for you.

But if come back after a while, your image will also have been deleted and replaced by the same default image as the others.

You will be able to reupload it as many times as you want, but in the end, my host will always win this game.

You can access the code of the deployed version by switching to the other branch.

To run the app locally, you will need to have Node and npm installed on your machine.

Then please follow these instructions :

- Create a MongoDB database and make sure you have admin access

- Clone the repository

- Copy/paste the [./backend/.env.example] file

- Rename the newly created `.env copy.example` file to `.env`

- Insert your MongoDB connection string into the `.env` file (don't forget to include your password)

- From the [./backend] folder, run `npm install` then `npm start`

- Your console should now be indicating `Listening on port 3000 - Connected to MongoDB`

- From the [root] folder, run `npm install` then `npm start`

- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`

- You're done !
